* Became biggest open source provider prior to be acquired by IBM

* Currently RHEL is a trusted partner to 90% of Fortune 500 companies

* Red Hat Inc. has rigid trademark rules restricting re-distribution of their officially RHEL versions but still provides its source code freely

---  

## Philosophy

* Committed to promotion, support, & defense of software freedom

* Mission statement:

  > *to be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology the open source way*

* Strive for more inclusivity in programic language & documentation:

  * Push for removal of controversial terms like "master" & "slave"

## Popular Derivatives

RHEL has many **community-driven** distributions:

* Fedora

* CentOS

There are also some **commercial** distributions of RHEL too:

* Oracle Linux

* Amazon Linux (primary AWS distribution)

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

Enterprise? Red Hat is NOT free?

* Still open source

* Subscription packaging model:
  * RHEL Server Standard
  * RHEL Server Premium

10+ Years of Support

* Stable & reliable, although maybe a little behind on the times

---

## Fedora Linux

Community-driven & free

More experimental

* Less stability

* Short version lifespan

  * Release every 6 months & 13 months of updates

Red Hat typically starts with Fedora when making new releases & polishes it to their own standards

---

## CentOS Linux

Claimed to be middle ground between RHEL & Fedora

Community-driven, free, & stable

* Mainly just Red Hat with branding thrown out

* Many CentOS board members also work for RedHat

CentOS Stream is the new and upcoming version of CentOS that will be used as a development ground to make releases of Fedora into the new Red Hat releases

---

## Package Manager

The default package managers for Red Hat distros are both RPM (Red hat package manager) and YUM/DNF.

* **RPM**

  * Allows for distribution, management, and ability to update software
  * Powerful in terms of installation of packages as well as inspecting and provisioning them
  
* **YUM/DNF**
  * Front-end tool for RPM which solves dependencies for packages

## Desktop Environments

Typically with the more common RHEL distros, they come with the following built in with the installer:

* **GNOME (Default)**
* KDE

Others for Installation on CentOS & Fedora:

* Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, i3, Deepin Desktop

---

## Community vs Enterprise Linux

* Community:

  * Free
  * Great for beginners
  * Great for experimentation

* Enterprise:
  
  * Paid
  * Supports long periods of time for servers
  * Supports business desires
