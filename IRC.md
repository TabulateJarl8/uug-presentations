## IRC history

IRC Protocol

- Application layer
- Client/server interaction
- Clients communicate with servers to transfer messages to other users

Mainly used for group communications, IRC also has whisper (direct) message
capabilities.

Client software is available for every major operating system that supports
internet.

While direct IRC usage has been steadily declining since 2003, it still sees
heavy usage in modern applications:

- Twitch.tv chat
- Slack
- Discord
